Database Architecture: A Comprehensive Structure Analysis

The database design for our recruitment and training platform presents a sophisticated and well-organized structure that efficiently manages user accounts, company information, testing systems, and CV handling. At its core, the architecture implements a hierarchical yet flexible approach to data management, with clear relationships between different entities that support the platform's various functions.

The system begins with the SuperUser entity, which stores essential administrative credentials including email and password, both implemented as varchar(35) fields. This superuser account connects directly to the Company entity, which maintains detailed organization information. Each company record includes a unique company name, email, password, and the number of accounts allocated to it. An important feature of the Company table is its relationship with the SuperUser email, establishing a clear administrative hierarchy for platform management.

The Test entity forms a crucial component of the assessment system, storing comprehensive information about each evaluation. Each test is uniquely identified by a test_id and includes essential details such as the test name, number of questions, and time limit. The test entity maintains a connection to its parent company through the company_name field, ensuring proper organization-specific test management. This entity serves as a parent to the Questions table, which stores the detailed content of each assessment.

The Questions table demonstrates particular attention to assessment design flexibility. Each question record includes a unique identifier and maintains its relationship to its parent test through the test_id field. The table accommodates various question formats with fields for the question text (allowing up to 2048 characters) and the correct answer. Additionally, it provides storage for four possible answer options, each implemented as integer(255) fields, offering flexibility in question design while maintaining structural consistency.

User management is handled through the User table, which stores individual user information including a unique identifier, full name, email, and password. The table also maintains a connection to the company structure through the company_name field, ensuring proper organizational alignment. This user data serves as a foundation for both test participation and CV management, as evidenced by its connections to other entities in the system.

The User_Test junction table efficiently manages the relationship between users and their assessments. This table creates a many-to-many relationship through userid and testtest_id fields, allowing for flexible assignment and tracking of test participation. This structure enables comprehensive monitoring of which users have taken which tests while maintaining data integrity.

Test results are managed through the Tests_Results table, which stores comprehensive assessment outcomes. Each result record includes a unique identifier, the achieved score, and references to both the test and user involved. The table also tracks completion dates and the total number of questions, providing a complete picture of test performance and participation.

The CV management system is implemented through two interconnected tables: CV_as_PDF and CV_Summarised. The CV_as_PDF table handles the storage of actual CV documents, including file names, sizes, and the binary data itself (accommodating up to 2000 bytes). This connects to the CV_Summarised table, which stores processed information from these CVs, including both soft and hard skills extracted from the documents, each allowing up to 1000 characters for comprehensive skill documentation.

The relationships between these entities are carefully designed to maintain referential integrity while allowing for flexible system operation. Solid lines in the diagram represent direct relationships, while dashed lines indicate logical connections that support system functionality without enforcing strict referential constraints. This thoughtful approach to relationship design ensures data consistency while maintaining system flexibility.

This database architecture demonstrates a deep understanding of recruitment and training platform requirements, providing robust support for user management, testing systems, and CV processing while maintaining clear organizational boundaries and data integrity. The design successfully balances the needs for data organization, system functionality, and scalability, creating a solid foundation for the platform's operations.
